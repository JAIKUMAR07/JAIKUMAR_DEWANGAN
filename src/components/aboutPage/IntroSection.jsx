              I'm Jaikumar Dewangan, a passionate For engineering who loves
              problem-solving and continuous learning.
              <br />
              Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in C++ and web development, and
              have developed several projects â€” some of which youâ€™ll find in the
              Projects section.
              <br />
              Alongside building applications, I've solved 300+ DSA problems
              across platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef, and actively
              participate in coding contests to sharpen my skills.
              <br />
              Beyond tech, I was an active member of Toastmasters Club, where I
              worked on my communication, public speaking, and leadership
              skills.
              <br />
              I volunteered for various roles, delivered speeches, and even
              completed the Persuasive Influence Pathway, which includes five
              levels of growth and leadership development.
              <br />
              In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing chess.
              <br />
              As I continue my journey in engineering, I'm currently looking for
              opportunities where I can apply my skills, take on real-world
              challenges, and grow as a developer and an Engineer.
